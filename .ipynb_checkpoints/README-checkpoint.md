# Apparel Sales Forecasting & Customer Analytics

This project takes a deep dive into apparel sales and customer behavior to understand what drives performance in a retail setting.  
It focuses on real business questions: which brands and categories sell best, how prices and discounts affect revenue, and how customer satisfaction links to sales.  
The final phase uses time series forecasting to project future sales trends and guide data-driven decision-making.

### Key Highlights
- Complete **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Visual insights on **pricing trends, customer ratings, brand performance, and category demand**
- Analysis of **seasonal sales patterns** (monthly and daily trends)
- **Return behavior and markdown impact** on overall revenue
- Creation of time-based features for forecasting (year, month, season)
- **Sales forecasting with Prophet**, predicting a steady upward trend in total revenue for the next six months

### Key Findings
- Higher product prices correlate positively with total revenue, while excessive markdowns reduce returns but not overall earnings  
- Customer ratings show a weak correlation with revenue, suggesting product type and pricing drive performance more than satisfaction scores  
- Revenue peaks during **mid-year seasons**, highlighting potential promotional opportunities  
- Prophet forecasts indicate continued growth, with projected monthly revenue reaching **1.5Mâ€“1.7M** by early 2026
