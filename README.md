# Apparel Sales Forecasting & Customer Analytics

This project takes a deep dive into apparel sales and customer patterns to understand what drives performance in a retail setting.  
It focuses on real business questions: which brands and categories sell best, how prices and discounts affect revenue, and how customer satisfaction links to sales.

**Key highlights:**
- Complete **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis**
- Detailed visual breakdowns of **pricing trends, customer ratings, and brand performance**
- Insights into **seasonal demand**, **return behavior**, and **markdown effects**
- Feature creation for forecasting: total revenue, time-based features (year, month, season)
- Correlation findings showing how **price**, **discounts**, and **ratings** influence sales

**Next phase:**  
Weâ€™ll move into **sales forecasting**, transforming these insights into predictive models that estimate future revenue trends and help plan inventory and pricing strategies.
