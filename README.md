### Apparel Sales Forecasting & Customer Analytics

This project explores sales performance and customer behavior for an apparel retail store.  
It focuses on uncovering insights around product pricing, brand performance, and customer satisfaction: then prepares the data for forecasting future sales trends.

**Whatâ€™s inside:**
- Clean, step-by-step exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visual insights on pricing, revenue, ratings, and brand performance
- Feature creation for future modeling (like total revenue, time-based features)
- Correlation analysis between pricing, discounts, and satisfaction

The next phase will include deeper customer insights and sales forecasting models using time series techniques.
